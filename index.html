        Hi, I'm James Treloar, a software engineer in training. I am studying for my Bachelor's at The University of New South Wales (although currently on exchange at New York University) and looking to graduate hopefully by the end of 2020. Within the Computer Science realm, my interest lies primarily in solving user driven problems. Working through the iterations of solving a real problem is what excites me and draws me to software engineering, a domain where keystrokes can change the world. While I am interested in seeing where the current hot topics of machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data processing lead, the fundamental question and process of the problem solving process is what drives my passion for this field.
